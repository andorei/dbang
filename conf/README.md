# Configuration (Spec) Files

By convention spec file name starts with the name of the dbang utility to which it relates:

* ddiff-<...>.py - ddiff spec file
* dtest-<...>.py - dtest spec file
* dget-<...>.py - dget spec file
* dput-<...>.py - dput spec file
* hedwig-<...>.py - hedwig spec file

Copy `sample-sources.py` to `sources.py` and specify your data sources in the latter.
